abstract: _Citizens worry about the influence of interest groups in politics and demand more transparency vis-a-vis policy-making and lobbying per se. I provide a model of informational lobbying with political agency and test under what conditions and through which mechanisms lobbying transparency operates. If policy-making is sufficiently transparent to begin with, lobbying disclosure requirements have no bite. If not, lobbying disclosure requirements (i) improve voters' ability to control their elected officials thus reducing the extent of pandering, (ii) induce information transmission by SIGs that would have otherwise not engaged in influence and (iii) generally induce better selection of politicians via elections. The effect of policy transparency on welfare is non-monotonic and highly dependent on lobbying transparency. As pandering incentives disappear, influence is made easier and the quality of policy-making worsens. Results are robust to voters being non-Bayesians as long as one intuitive condition holds. _
